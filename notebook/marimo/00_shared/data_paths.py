    # The shared cells: connect, and bring data in

    Both quickstarts are built with these cells (`data-scientist/00_quickstart` and `ml-engineer/00_quickstart`), so the
    two cannot drift apart. Open your persona's quickstart rather than this notebook; it runs on its own all the same.

    **Dataset:** the Pharma sample (`pharma_trials`) unless you pick another below. **Loaded beforehand:** nothing.
    **Run time:** about ten minutes, most of it loading the sample the first time.

    The kernel **Exasol (Starter Kit)** opens the database from the kit's encrypted store: there is no host, user or
    password in this notebook. The second cell lists what the database holds; a virtual schema is a connected source.

    ## Review and approve the roles

    The kit profiles the chosen table and shows the evidence behind each proposed role: one dropdown per column,
    labelled with its type, null share and distinct values or span, the runner-up for its role under it. Pick a role
    for each column, then click **Approve descriptor**. The next cell waits for your approval; it does not run on a
    draft (in Marimo it stops until the button is clicked, then runs on its own). In a plain Python session, call
    `review.approve({"COLUMN": "role", ...})` instead. A headless run (`EXAKIT_NB_AUTO_APPROVE=1`) approves only a
    proposal equal to the current approved version, writing nothing; any other proposal stays a draft and the run
    says why (`=force` approves it anyway).
